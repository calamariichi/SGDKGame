This is a personal project to learn how to develop games for the Sega Gensis/Mega Drive.

I am following multiple tutorials on YouTube to help me understand coding for the Sega MD. The goal is to create a game that can run on real hardware and to have a minimum playable product. Then, I would like to work on art assets throughout the year when I feel like it.
